+ Project summary: In this project, we created an base line model and advanced model to test weather the best fit and accuracy for image classification for Cifar 10 data set.
  + in the baseline model we use four major prediction and get best result of 
    +Random Forest
    +K-Nearest Neighbor
    +Logistic Regression
    +Support Vector Machine
  + in the advanced model we use 9 layer and get results of 0.7360
  + in the second advanced model we improve the model and get final result of 0.8799
